    "# Diffusion Models \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we introduce diffusion models - not the diffusion in fluid dynamics, but in deep learning. It is one of the most popular approach to generate images with specified distribution. Specifically, we can use it to generate high-quality images that are similar to the training dataset with high diversity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The name **diffusion** came from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In thermodynamics, diffusion describes the process of molecules disperse from highly concentrated region to a lower concentration region. "
