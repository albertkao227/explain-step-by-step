### Statistics and machine learning topics explained step-by-step 

I am always facinated by machine learning or deep learning or any math/physics theorem that seems nonsensical but is indeed true. While it is very satisfying to understand the novelty of an algorithm, the process is often time-intensive. It usually takes a lot of time to identify the important idea of each step, appreciate the logical transition to next step, and following the derivations that go with it. Even worse, authors often assumed prior knowledge about the subject, and ommited the explanation for intermediary steps. Tutorials available online are often fragmented, and piecing together different ideas from different sources is not an easy task. Inspired by https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when, I would like to start my own journey of explaining (almost) every step of an ML/DL/math/physics algorithm to the smallest detail.
