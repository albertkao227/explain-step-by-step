### Statistics and machine learning topics explained step-by-step 

I am always facinated by machine learning algorithms or deep learning or any math/physics theorem that seems nonsensical - but is indeed true. It is a very gratifying feeling to understand the details of an algorithm, but the process is very time-consuming. Authors frequently assumed prior knowledge, and omitted detailed explanations for intermediary steps. One has to read through multiple resources to get the full picture. Inspired by https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when, I would like to start my own journey of explaining (almost) every step of ML or DL algorithms. Hopefully readers can walk away feeling there are no gaps in their knowledge for the topic.
